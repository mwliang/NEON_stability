# Based on our priori structural equation modeling (SEM) (Extended Data Fig 2), 
# we have carried out several SEMs to take account for potential associations among variables.

# First, we have started a full model with all potential pathway effects.

# Second, after attaining a satisfactory model fit, 
# in which the model has low AIC and p > 0.05 without missing significant pathways 
# using Shipley¡¯s test of d-separation (Lefcheck 2016), we then introduced each climatic factors. 

# Lastly, based on the rule of model selection (lower AIC), we have chosen our final SEM.

# second, based on the empirical bivariate relationships of climatic factors to diversity and stability.

# Since the piecewise SEM decomposes the network by combining multiple linear regressions 
# for each response to generate inferences about the entire SEM (Lefcheck 2016), 
# therefore, we checked the bivariate relationships between all climatic variables 
# to ensure that a linear model was appropriate before we introduced these variables into the SEM. 
# Because the introduced variables may mediate the effects strengths of other climatic variables 
# through a significant bivariate correlation. 

# Specifically, precipitation and temperature are highly correlated to their seasonality among 36 NEON sites:

summary(lm(MAP_mm ~ MAT_C, data = NEON_stab.data)) # P = 0.016
